# Skill-India-Summer-Olympic-Data-Analysis-Assignment

### About this Internship
This is my Assignment Project of Skill India Internship Programme organized by Elite Techno Groups. Ashish Jangara is my Instructor for this Project and Internship, Along with this Project we had created 2 more Projects for this Internship, CAR Data Analysis and Inventory Management System and a Final Project of Breast Cancer Detection also we are going to make.

### Project Details
Here I have answered few questions based on 'summer.csv' dataset. It is containing more than 31000 data of past olympic records from 1896 to 2012 and here I have analysed the each and every question with the help of Graphs, visuals, etc.

### Project Explanation
#### 1.) Firstly I have imported the important libraries like numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot
#### 2.) Then I uploaded the dataset 'summer.csv' and checked its total rows and columns using df.shape and for reading and displaying data I used df.head() function.
#### 3.) After Reading the dataset I performed some data Preprocessing techniques to remove the Null values in order to avoid the problem in analysing later on.
#### 4.) I used isnull(), isnull().sum() and dropna() function to preprocess the data.
#### 5.) After Data Preprocessing Step, I used several functions to fetch the required Problem statement solution and then I plotted graphs like Line graph, Bar graph, etc.
